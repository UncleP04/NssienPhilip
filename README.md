##CONNECT WITH NSSIEN PHILIP.

Hi there! My name is NSSIEN PHILIP, and I'm a Software(WEB) developer with years of 
experience in the industry. I'm passionate about creating high-quality websites that not only look great, but also function flawlessly.

Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to 
make our lives easier. As I grew older, I became increasingly interested in programming 
and started tinkering with various languages and frameworks in my spare time. It wasn't long before I realized that web development was my true calling.


Over the years, I've worked on a wide variety of projects, from simple brochure websites
to complex e-commerce platforms. I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and 
other web technologies, and I'm always eager to learn more. I'm particularly interested in
Full-Stack development and user experience design, as I believe that a well-designed website 
can make all the difference in how users interact with a business or organization.

When I started learning web development at a Tech Hub called “AFRICINNOVATE” it was very
interesting and mind boosting. Over the weeks, I became slow and unfocus due to lots of bugs,
and physical issues. But, I had a strong mindset that will always be ready to focus and make sure to archive set out goals. 

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me exploring new hiking trails, gaming or trying out
new recipes in the kitchen. I'm a big believer in work-life balance and strive to maintain a healthy mix of professional and personal pursuits.
